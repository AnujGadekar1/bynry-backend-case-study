# Bynry Backend Engineering Intern – Case Study

## Candidate Information

* **Name:** Anuj Gadekar
* **Role Applied For:** Backend Engineering Intern

---

## Overview

This repository contains my response to the Backend Engineering Intern case study
provided by **Bynry Inc**. The case study evaluates core backend engineering
capabilities, including code review and debugging, database schema design, and
API implementation for a SaaS-based inventory management system.

The focus of this submission is on **backend correctness, system design thinking,
and clarity of reasoning**, rather than full-scale production implementation.

## Case Study Contents

The written case study (PDF) addresses the following sections:

### 1. Code Review and Debugging

* Identification of technical and business logic issues in the provided API
* Analysis of runtime failures and potential production impact
* Improved implementation with validation, transaction safety, and error handling

### 2. Database Schema Design

* Normalized schema supporting multi-warehouse inventory
* Support for suppliers, bundles, and inventory audit logs
* Identification of ambiguous or missing requirements with clarification questions

### 3. API Design and Implementation

* Design and implementation of a low-stock alerts API
* Clear assumptions and edge-case handling
* Consideration of scalability and real-world SaaS constraints

## Sample Code

The `src/app.py` file contains **illustrative Flask-based code** used to
demonstrate API structure, data flow, and backend reasoning.

This code is **not intended to be production-ready**, and is included only to
support the conceptual explanations provided in the case study.

The emphasis of this submission is on **clarity of thought, correctness, and
maintainability**, rather than exhaustive implementation.

---

## Approach

While working on this case study, I focused on:

* Understanding how backend systems fail at runtime, not just at compile time
* Designing schemas that preserve data integrity while supporting scalability
* Clearly documenting assumptions where requirements were incomplete
* Avoiding overengineering while maintaining production awareness

---

## Notes

This submission is intended to showcase backend problem-solving skills,
engineering judgment, and communication clarity. The repository structure and
contents are deliberately kept minimal to align with the scope of the case study.

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission.
